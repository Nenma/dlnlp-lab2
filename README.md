# Deep Learning applied in NLP - Laboratory 2

## Task description

Get familiar with syntactic and dependency parsing by generating the corresponding trees for the following sentences:

> Papa eats octopus in pajamas.

> John often eats sea food or octopus.

> John and Mary eat often together.

Steps:

1. Write a suitable grammar, able to correctly parse all sentences, with all their senses.
2. Use existing modules to extract phrase structure trees for these sentences.
3. Implement a dependency parser (using, for instance, spaCY, NLTK or Stanza) and parse the three sentences above.
4. Describe an application which needs syntactic and/or dependency parsing. Explain briefly why.
